***This project is not completed yet.***

This project aims to apply some programming foundations concepts and Python functionalities applied to a data analysis program which based on some data answer different requirments.

## Respository structure

- The folder [Code](/Code/) contains the code of this project.
- The folder [Documentation](/Documentation/) contains the repository documentation files and context about this project.
- The file [data.csv](/data.csv) is the data source for this project.

## Statement

This [document](/Documentation/statement.pdf) contains the context of the problem, requirments and functionality for each file and function.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

- Reading and writing files with CSV format.
- Implementation of traversal algorithms and modification of lists.
- Complex data structures of dictionaries within lists and of lists within dictionaries.

## How does it work?

Once you execute the application, the options will be displayed by the console and you can start to navegate and interact with the program with the console. In the console, the program responses will be displayed.

The file [consola_asistencia_congreso.py](/Code/consola_asistencia_congreso.py) has one function for each requirment executing the neccesary functions from the file [asistencia_congreso.py](/Code/asistencia_congreso.py) that help to solve the requirments.


## Execution

To execute the program you have to execute the [consola_asistencia_congreso.py](/Code/consola_asistencia_congreso.py) file.

Before any other option, in each execution you have to execute the first option to load the data and be able to continue with the others. Once you execute the first option you should type the data file name, it is "data.csv".
